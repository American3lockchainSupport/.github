# We are living in Blocklife.

Welcome to the AmericanBlockchainSupport Github!

- Read out manifesto: [blocklife.org/manifesto](https://blocklife.org/manifesto/)
- The *only* official communication channel is the Blocklife Slack space. Use it to connect with hackers and mentors, and to get updates from the organizers throughout the hackathon. (You will get private link, if you join our community.)
- To hack at Blocklife, you are **required** to obtain a [hacker visa](https://blocklife.org/visa/).

If you are finding a new team or crypto dev, follow this link [find_team/issues](https://github.com/American3lockchainSupport/find_team/issues/new/choose)
